## Tasks

1. The `jumping-button` folder contains the files you need for implementing a "jumping" button. When clicking the button, it goes from the right to the left, and the button text changes to `Go Left!`. When clicking it again, the button goes to the left and the text changes to `Go Right!`.
    - When opening the `jumping-button/index.html` file, there is button is on the left side of its container, with the text `Go Right!`.
    - When the button is on the left side, clicking it results in the button moving to the right side of the container.
    - When the button is on the right side, the button text is `Go Left!`
    - When the button is on the right side, clicking it results in the button moving to the left side of the container.

2. The `change-my-color` folder contains files for implementing a color changing button. When the button in `change-my-color/index.html` is clicked, it must change its background color to red. When clicked again, it switches back its background color to the default value.
    - When the button in `change-my-color/index.html` is clicked, its background color changes to `red`
    - When the button is clicked again, its background color changes back to default.

3. The `change-others-color` folder contains the tools for your next task. When the button in `change-others-color/index.html` is clicked, it changes the background color of the `span` element to `red`.
    - When clicking the button in `change-others-color/index.html`, the element next to it changes its background color to `red`

4. Implement a basic click counter in the `counter` folder. When the button in `counter/index.html` is clicked, the number on it increases by one.
    - Clicking the button in `counter/index.html` increases the number on it by one on each click.
